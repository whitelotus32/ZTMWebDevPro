// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.

// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.

// Make a keyless car!
// This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:

// "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off"

// IF they say they are 18, respond with:
